# Lets create a virtual environment for this project in VS code
# for windows

step 1: Go to View tab and click on terminal

step 2: Create a virtual environmebt
python -m venv virtual_env (you can choose you own venv name than virtual_environmet)

step 3: Activae the virtual environment
virtual_env\Scripts\activate (make sure virtual_env is the venv name you gave)

step 4: Install the packages in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

Its a good idea to freeze the installed libraries:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

If you need to deactive the environment:
deactivate

Once the environment is created, you can install additional packages:
pip install package_name

If you close the session and restart again, you need to activate the virtual environment:
virtual_env\Scripts\activate (remember to change virtual_env to you env name if its different)
